# rollable

This is a quick project to make it easier to generate rollable dice blocks on D&D beyond

The tool can be used via a GUI at https://scherma.github.io/rollable

To use the function in your own tools, import src/rollable.js

The output is a text block that can be copied in to D&D Beyond monster stat blocks

If you make choices that will not work, an error message will be displayed
